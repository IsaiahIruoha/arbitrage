            <h2>A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Finding Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Paths</h2>
            <p>This study, conducted by a group of 7 undergraduate students at Queen's University, presents a novel approach to finding optimal arbitrage paths in cryptocurrency exchanges using reinforcement learning techniques inspired by DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero. By reframing the problem as a Markov Decision Process and leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search with a Graph Neural Network, we demonstrate promising convergence towards optimal solutions. Despite computational constraints, our model outperforms random strategies and exhibits significant speed gains compared to traditional methods like Depth First Search. Further research avenues include exploring different GNN architectures and training on specialized currency market graphs before considering deployment in live trading scenarios.</p>

          <h3>Currency Arbitrage</h3>
            <p>Arbitrage is the term for trading that results in risk-free profit. This is traditionally done by exploiting a difference in price of the same asset in two different markets - buying an asset in one market, and selling for a higher price in another. Another form of arbitrage is currency arbitrage, also known as triangle arbitrage. This is the process of generating risk-free profit via a series of cyclic trades in a currency exchange, ending with more of the original currency than was started with. Typically, any obvious discrepancies in stock or currency markets are so quickly capitalized on that they often disappear before many people can take advantage of them. This has reduced the profitability of arbitrage in stock and currency markets.
              <br></br><br></br>
            <h3>A Pathfinding Problem</h3>
            In order to find currency arbitrage paths in a cryptocurrency market, we must represent the cryptocurrency exchange as a graph. In this graph, each node represents a currency and each edge a potential trade. Lastly, the edge weight of each edge is the exchange rate between the respective source and target node (see this adjacent graph for an example of this). The problem of finding the optimal arbitrage path given a graph is equivalent to finding the longest path containing a cycle, a known NP-Hard problem. This means there is no known polynomial-time solution. In this project, we apply reinforcement learning techniques to approximate the Optimal Arbitrage Problem.</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <hr />
        
        <p>We apply a method for solving NP-Hard problems proposed in the research paper CombOpt Zero. In their paper, they modify the techniques used by Google DeepMindâ€™s AlphaGo Zero team. In order to do so, they rephrase the NP-Hard problem as a discrete, one player game (also known as a Markov Decision Process, or MDP), they apply Monte Carlo Tree Search to instances of their MDP to generate self-play data and fit a Graph Neural Network on the data via offline reinforcement learning. We attempt to extend their research to the Optimal Arbitrage Problem.</p>
        <h3>Optimal Arbitrage Game</h3>
        <p>A Deterministic Markov Decision Process is a rigorous way of defining a game with discrete game states. It requires the definition of a set of states, <em>S</em>, an action space (the available actions at some state) <em>A<sub>s</sub></em>, and a reward function <em>R</em>, that maps an action from a state to a real number, <em>r</em>, representing the reward for taking the action. The goal of the game is to optimize the total rewards given an initial state.
            <br></br><br></br>
            In the Optimal Arbitrage Game, a state is a currency in the graph, the action space of each state is all available trades to another currency, and the reward for an action is the logarithm of the exchange rate from one currency to another. Defining the optimal arbitrage game allows us to generate self-play data from instances of the game using Monte Carlo Tree Search.
        </p>
        <h3>Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)</h3>
        <p>In our method, we use a Graph Convolutional Network to learn a policy to solve the Optimal Arbitrage Game. Graph neutral networks are a type of neural network that can accept a graph as input. In our case, since we are training a neural network to make predictions on Optimal Arbitrage Game states, which are represented as graphs, we need to use a model that can accurately recognize graph inputs.
          <br></br><br></br>
          Our graph neural network accepts Optimal Arbitrage Game states (stored as a Pytorch Geometric Graph) as input, and produces a value and policy vector. The value vector has one index for each currency representing an estimate of the total rewards we can obtain by trading into each currency. Similarly, the policy vector represents a recommendation of with what probability to take each action.</p>

            <h3>Monte Carlo Tree Search</h3>
            <p>MCTS is a computationally intensive algorithm used to find a policy from an initial game state. It does so in a similar way youâ€™d think about a chain of possible moves in a game like chess. Following a specified formula, in this case the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), it considers different actions from the initial game state and keeps track of the rewards generated from choosing each option. In doing so, the algorithm forms a decision tree (see the adjacent figure) of all moves it has considered, hence the name. After running for a specified number of iterations, the algorithm outputs a policy for the initial state, which is a recommendation of the probability with which each move should be taken. In our case, this algorithm incorporates the policy and value predictions from our graph neural network, and returns an enhanced policy recommendation that we use to tune the networkâ€™s policy vector.</p>

            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>There are two major components to our training system: a data generation system and a model evaluator.  Before running, we initialize an untrained Graph Convolutional Network, <em>f</em>.
            <br></br><br></br>
              The goal of the data generator is to collect samples of the form <em>(S, A, &pi;, R)</em>. Here, <em>A</em> is the action taken from state <em>S</em> chosen according to the MCTS enhanced policy, <em>&pi;</em>, and <em>R</em> is the cumulative reward generated from <em>S</em>. The data generator does so by initializing random instances of Optimal Arbitrage Game objects <em>(S)</em>, and running MCTS with <em>f</em> to generate an enhanced policy, <em>&pi;</em>. It samples the action, <em>A</em> from <em>&pi;</em> receiving a reward, <em>r</em>. This is repeated until the game reaches a terminal state, and each sample is saved. 
            <br></br><br></br>
              After doing so for a specified number of graphs, <em>f</em> is trained on randomly sampled batches of the data using MSE loss to fit its value vector on <em>R</em>, and CrossEntropy loss to fit its policy vector to <em>&pi;</em>, obtaining a trained model, <em>f<sub>1</sub></em>. The model evaluator compares the average performance of <em>f</em> and <em>f<sub>1</sub></em> on random game instances, and keeps the better performer. The entire system then repeats, using the better of the two models.

            <p>The model was trained for 72 hours in total, and saved in 24 hour intervals. The cumulative average performance of each model was recorded over 50 runs on 1000 random Games.
              As seen in the adjacent cumulative reward graph, the model clearly outperforms the randomly generated paths. Further, each successive training cycle also showed evident improvement, indicating convergence toward a solution to the Optimal Arbitrage Problem. 
              <br></br><br></br>
              Overall, we consider our results to be a success, with justification to further explore our techniques using more compute. This is particularly important considering the restraints faced as we were training the model on a Mac M1. An analogous model, DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero, took 41 TPU years to reach superhuman ability, costing them over $35 million.

              Due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets, another key metric of success for this project is the speed at which the model was able to predict these paths. A deterministic solution to the problem, Depth First Search, took over 20 minutes to find a path for a model with just 15 nodes. In contrast, our model was able to predict arbitrage paths for graphs with 500 nodes with an average time of under a tenth of a second.
              <br></br><br></br>
              Future research would include testing different GNN architectures, and training on graphs more specialized to currency markets. Finally, additional research like maximum model drawdown would need to be analyzed before it is used in live trading.
